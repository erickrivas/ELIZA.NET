# ELIZA.NET
A modern .NET linked library implementation of the classic ELIZA chatbot.  Written in C#.

To install, simply copy Release\ELIZA.NET.dll to a directory accessible to your app and add it as a reference in VS.

If you want to install an ELIZA test script to the system registry, use RegistryInstall.exe.

It is strongly recommended that you execute RunTests.exe on your ELIZA script to ensure there aren't any problems.  

You can find the DOCTOR script (and its corresponding test script JSON) in the scripts directory.

To see a simple and easy to recreate example of a console application using ELIZA.NET, take a look at src\TestApp\ELIZA.

ELIZA.NET Copyright (C) 2018 by Kris Craig.  Based on the original ELIZA algorithm and DOCTOR script written by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966.
